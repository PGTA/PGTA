Video games are a unique form of entertainment that require a high degree of user interaction. The nondeterministic 
nature of this interaction makes it difficult to synchronize gameplay with a soundtrack. Ambient audio is used in video games as a
means of enhancing immersion, and having this ambient audio react to gameplay furthers this immersion. One way to achieve
this level of integration between ambient audio and gameplay is to procedurally generate sound based on in-game events.
Though this technique has been explored before
by game developers, all of the work has been proprietary and thus not accessible to the public. \textbf{PGTA} provides 
an open-source solution to procedurally generate audio targeted towards integration with game engines. In addition to 
procedural generation of tracks using pre-recorded audio samples, PGTA also offers a means of dynamically 
transitioning between tracks. The PGTA engine also comes with a custom editor for PGTA projects providing an intuitive method
to create tracks and transitions while requiring minimal technical skills. PGTA provides an easily accessible and user friendly
approach to creating procedurally generated ambient audio.
