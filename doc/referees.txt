Use this file to nominate possible referees for your project. Notes:

- We recommend you nominate three candidates, but you may nominate
  more or less than that. If you nominate fewer, or if your candidates
  are not available, then you will be assigned referees.

- Assigned referees are likely to be from the core SE faculty, or
  others invited by them: for example, SE alumnus, ECE lab staff, etc.

- It is generally recommended (but not required) that your customer be
  one of your referees.

- Each nomination should include a name, an email address, and a
  rationale. The rationale explains why you want that person as a
  referee. The rationale is read by the SE491 instructor and by the
  referee.

- Contacting referees: Do not contact core SE Faculty directly, unless
  they are your customer or have previously expressed personal
  interest in your project. The SE491 instructor will contact them in
  a coordinated manner on behalf of all requesting teams. Please
  contact your customer directly. If there are other referees that you
  are interested in who are not likely to get requests from other
  teams then you may contact them directly (and CC the SE491
  instructor).

- The job of the referee is to show up on symposium day and grade your
  project. This should take 30-45 minutes. First the referee goes to
  your booth to see your poster and demo. Then they see your talk.

- Remote referees: We will try to accommodate remote referees if that
  person has a particular interest in the project. The most common
  reason for this request is a remote customer.
