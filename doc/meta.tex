\renewcommand{\teamname}{Procedurally Generated Transitional Audio (PGTA)}

\renewcommand{\projectdesc}{
This project provides a solution that removes the need for using pre-recorded compositions as 
music/ambience in games. This is achieved by dynamically modifying a multitude of sound-state parameters that 
are used as input to a scheduling algorithm responsible for producing structured ambient music from pieced together 
audio clips. Since the audio generation is dynamic and parameter driven, the music it produces is able 
to seamlessly respond and adapt to in-game events with minimal latency.
