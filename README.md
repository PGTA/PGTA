The purpose of the proposed solution is to remove the need for using pre-recorded compositions as music in games. This is to be achieved by setting a multitude of sound-state parameters that will be used as input to an algorithm responsible for producing structured ambient music. The algorithm is dynamic because it would allow for transitions resulting from parameter changes. This means that the music it produces would be able to seamlessly respond to in-game events.
